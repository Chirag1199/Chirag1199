- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chirag1199
- 👀 I’m interested in software developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithm using java langauge. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects in the field of Cryptography. Recently, I implemented RSA encryption and decryption algorithm to generate private and 
      public key. Even I have successfully implemented SHA-256 encyption algorithm which are one of the most trending technology used in cryptocurrency mining, for eg., BITCOIN.
      which is basically used for generating HASH code of 256 and 512 depending on the user. Soon, i will be contributing my projects on github.
